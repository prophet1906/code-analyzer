# Code Analyzer
This project is a toy example to understand and demonstrate concepts learned during software testing course.
Using [SootUp](https://soot-oss.github.io/SootUp/) for static analysis and [GraphStream](https://graphstream-project.org/) for visualization.
I also considered using antlr, but it requires building too many things from scratch.

## Control Flow Graph
Here is a sample screenshot for control flow graph generated for a simple sorting algorithm implementation.
